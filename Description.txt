DESCRIPTION AND INFORMATION

This project is meant to be a simulation of the coin exchange market,
where coins are being bought and sold throughout the day by people 
all over the world.

The program allows users to buy or sell a certain amount of coins,
and then the simulation runs to show the values of the coins changing
throughout the day. The features of the coin exchange are built off 
of loading a text file, using a hash table, using a queue, and more. 
Then once the simulation is over, the results are shown to the user 
so that they can find out if their transactions were good or not. 

The complexity of the entire coin exchange is O(1) and at worst it
would be O(n).
