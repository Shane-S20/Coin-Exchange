To use the coin exchange, first select if you would like to buy, sell,  or just
let the simulation run without your transaction. If you choose to buy or sell
coins, the exchange will then ask which of the 3 coins you would like to exchange. 
The exchange then asks for the amount of coins they want to buy or sell.
The simulation then runs to implement the random buying and selling of coins 
that would happen in real life. Then the results of the simulation are printed,
and the data is saved in the text file Coins.txt for the next time the user runs 
the coin exchange.
